some sort of visual novel thing. powered by love2d.org

### to run:  
\- download love 0.10.0 (might not be compatible with later versions, when they come out)  
\- drag the folder to love.exe or love.app

finally decided to actually pursue a goal i've had for a while of making some kind of audiovisual story.
if all goes well, this will end up as a somewhere-hovering-around-mediocre visual novel type thing that defies genre just enough to be interesting, but not enough to be pretentious. maybe.
i'm also hoping to improve at programming so i'm trying to keep everything tidier code-wise than the stuff i usually make.

features i want to implement:  
\- [MOSTLY DONE] "file format" for making scenes, with a (possibly even usable by anybody who didn't code it) scene editor  
\- [DONE] simple 3D viewing support (go cross-eyed to see 3D image)  
\- [???] music  
\- [LMAO] actually engaging story and characters? (good luck on this one)  
\- [NOT YET] functional, user-friendly (and pretty!) menu with info on characters (characters you haven't met yet will be greyed out)

so, yeah. feels weird to be actually doing this after so long of only thinking about it - probably doesn't seem like a big deal in writing, but it's a strangely big deal to me at least at the time of writing this. such a big deal that i apparently feel the need to write a goddamn autobiography in this readme file. anyway. knowing my track record i'll likely abandon this in a week or so, but if not, hey, cool.
