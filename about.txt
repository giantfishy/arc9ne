arc9ne is pretty much a visual novel.

its main purpose revolves around the concept that if i actually finish it (which, if you're reading this, i did!), i'll know that i can theoretically actually make things, and i might be able to think about working on bigger projects with more confidence.
because of this, i've strived to let go of the idea that it has to be good (better a lame finished product than nothing at all!), but hopefully you'll like it anyway. either way, i'm always appreciative of any feedback you might have. the best way to contact me is probably @phijinks on twitter.

most of the stuff in here is made by me, which is a problem because i'm not really a writer, artist, programmer or musician, let alone all four at once. working on that though. below is a list of the tools i used.

code: notepad++, lua, love2d
visuals: paint tool sai, paint.net, processing
music: fl studio

fonts used: caviar dreams by lauren thompson
