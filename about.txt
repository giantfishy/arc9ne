arc9ne is a digital comic/cartoon/thing. i'm not really sure what to call it yet.

its main purpose revolves around the concept that if i actually finish it (which, if you're reading this, i did!), i'll know that i can theoretically actually make things, and i might be able to think about working on bigger projects with more confidence.
because of this, "make a perfect story that everybody will like" isn't high up on my priority list, but i hope you'll like it anyway. either way, i'm always appreciative of any feedback you might have. the best way to contact me is probably @phijinks on twitter.

most of the stuff in here is made by me, which is a problem because i'm not really a writer, artist, programmer or musician, let alone all four at once. working on that though. below is a list of the tools i used.

code: notepad++, lua, love2d
visuals: paint tool sai, paint.net, processing
music: fl studio

thanks for checking this out, by the way!
